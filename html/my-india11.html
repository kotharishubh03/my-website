            <p ><i><b>India</b></i> , officially the <i><b>Republic of India</b></i> , is a country in <i><b>South Asia </b></i>. It is the second-most populous country , 
                the seventh-largest country by area , and the most populous <i><b>democracy</b></i> in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian
                Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with <i><b>Pakistan to the west ; China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the
                north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east</b></i>.In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar
                Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.
                 Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human 
                genetic diversity.Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the 
                Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from
                 the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted 
                in the northern regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming 
                social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their 
                collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

                <img src="D:\\programing\\html\\WDL\\images\\Hon._Ram_Nath_Kovind_Sir.jpg" id=img2 alt="Hon. Ram Nath Kovind Sir">
                <p> The Hon. Ram Nath Kovind (born 1 October 1945) is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current President of India since 25 July 2017. Previously
                    he had served as the 26th Governor of Bihar from 2015 to 2017 and was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha from 1994 to 2006. Kovind was nominated as a 
                    presidential candidate by the ruling NDA coalition and won the 2017 presidential election. Before entering politics, he was a lawyer for 16 years and 
                    practised in the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court until 1993.Ram Nath Kovind took the oath as the 14th President of India on 25 July 2017. 
                    He is the first leader from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to occupy the Office of President of India.Ram Nath Kovind was born on 1 October 1945, 
                    in Paraunkh village in the Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh, as the youngest of five brothers and two sisters. His father Maikulal Kovind ran 
                    a small shop. Kovind was born in a mud hut, which eventually collapsed. He was only five when his mother died of burns when their thatched dwelling caught fire.
                    Kovind later donated the land to the community. Kovind was born into the Kori caste, considered underprivileged even among the Dalits.
                    After his elementary school education, he had to walk each day to Kanpur village, 8 km away, to attend junior school, as nobody in the village had a bicycle.
                    He holds a bachelor's degree in commerce and an LLB from DAV College (affiliated with Kanpur University).

                <h2>The Hon. Prime Minister </h2>
                <img src="D:\\programing\\html\\WDL\\images\\Hon._N_modi.jpg" id=img3 alt="Hon. Narandera Modi Ji">
                <p>
                    Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi stormed to power on a surge of popular expectation and anger at corruption and weak growth.

Despite Mr Modi's polarising image, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) scored an unprecedented landslide victory in the May 2014 parliamentary elections.

It was the first time in 30 years that a single party had won a clear parliamentary majority.

Mr Modi fought on his record as chief minister of the economically successful state of Gujarat, promising to revitalise India's flagging economy.

But his time in Gujarat was overshadowed by accusations that he did too little to stop the religious riots in 2001, which saw more than 1,000 people - mainly Muslims - killed.
